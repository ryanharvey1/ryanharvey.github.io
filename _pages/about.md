Currently, I am a doctoral candidate in the lab of Benjamin Clark at the University of New Mexico and expect to graduate in May 2021. I'm searching for a postdoctoral position that will start in 2021.  

My main interest is in exploring circuit-level dynamics that relate to behavior & memory and how these dynamics are altered in neurodevelopment disorders.

I received a B.A. in psychology from Purdue University in 2014. During this degree, I had a variety of research experience including exploring human navigation and memory in virtual environments as well as recording single unit hippocampal neurons in freely moving rodents. From 2015 to 2016, I acquired an M.Sc. degree in psychology from the University of New Mexico. During this time, I explored how the anterior thalamus contributes to spatial memory using selective temporary inactivations. As a doctoral candidate, I am investigating the effect of developmental alcohol exposure on hippocampal microcircuits and neural ensembles involved in memory reactivation.
