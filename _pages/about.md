My overall aim is to contribute to our understanding of circuit level dynamics that give rise to spatial navigation and memory.  Currently, my work involves understanding functional loss after developmental alcohol exposure using high-density electrophysiology recordings in behaving rodents.

I grew up in Fort Wayne, a small town in Indiana 3 hours away from Chicago. I received my B.A. from the Purdue University. During this time, I volunteered in the lab of Dr. Ryan Yoder where I researched spatial navigation and memory in otoconia-deficient mice. At the same time, I volunteered for two other researchers: Dr. Carol Lawton and Dr. Punya Nachappa. In Dr. Lawton's lab, I helped research human spatial navigation and memory in virtual environments and motion sickness in response to visual optic flow. For Dr. Nachappa, I investigated the effect of microgravity on soybean growth. After a year as lab technician in Dr. Yoder's lab, I applied to the UNM Psychology PhD program with a concentration in cognition, brain, and behavior. I am currently in my final year of graduate research in the lab of Dr. Benjamin Clark. In the Clark lab, I have researched the contribution of the anterior thalamus to hippocampal dynamics and spatial memory. Also, I have investigated he impact of prenatal alcohol exposure on spatial processing, which is the focus of my dissertation work.
