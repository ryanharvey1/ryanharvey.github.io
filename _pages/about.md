I am a doctoral candidate at the University of New Mexico in the department of psychology.

My doctoral research with Benjamin J. Clark is focused on how hippocampal activity, and associated spatial memory, is altered following prenatal alcohol exposure. 

Broadly, my aim is to contribute to our understanding of circuit-level dynamics that give rise to spatial navigation and memory.
