I am a doctoral candidate in the University of New Mexico's psychology department.

My doctoral research with Benjamin Clark is focused on how hippocampal activity is altered following prenatal alcohol exposure. 

More broadly, my aim is to contribute to our understanding of circuit-level dynamics that give rise to spatial navigation and memory.
