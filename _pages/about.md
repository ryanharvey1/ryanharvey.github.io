I am a postdoctoral associate at Cornell University supervised by [Dr. Antonio Fernandez-Ruiz and Dr. Azahara Oliva](https://braincomputation.org/). 

My research interests broadly involve exploring circuit-level dynamics related to behavior & memory. 

I received a bachelorâ€™s degree from Purdue University in 2014 where I had a variety of research experiences, including exploring human navigation and memory in virtual environments with Dr. Carol Lawton, as well as recording single unit hippocampal neurons in freely moving rodents with Dr. Ryan Yoder (Harvey et al, [2018](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2018.04.034)). 

From 2015 to 2016, I acquired an M.Sc. degree in psychology from the University of New Mexico supervised by Dr. Benjamin Clark. During this time, I explored how the anterior thalamus contributes to spatial memory using selective temporary inactivations (Clark & Harvey, [2016](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nlm.2016.06.002), Harvey et al, [2017](https://doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2017.00094)). As a doctoral candidate at the University of New Mexico, I investigated the effect of developmental alcohol exposure on hippocampal place cell and sharp-wave ripple activity (Harvey et al, [2019](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2019.09.018) [2020](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2020.06.077) [2021](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.06.29.450435)).

Currently, in the lab of  Dr. Antonio Fernandez-Ruiz and Dr. Azahara Oliva, I am investigating the diversity of ripple-associated cell sequences using closed-loop optogenetics, silicon probe recordings, and advanced analytical tools.
